# MSMARCO with S-NET extraction
* A CNTK(Microsoft deep learning toolkit) implementation of [S-NET: FROM ANSWER EXTRACTION TO ANSWER
GENERATION FOR MACHINE READING COMPREHENSION] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04815.pdf) with some modifications. 
* This project is designed for the [MSMARCO](http://www.msmarco.org/) dataset
* Code structure is based on [CNTK BIDAF Example](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/nikosk/bidaf/Examples/Text/BidirectionalAttentionFlow/msmarco)

## Requirements

There are some required library for training, if you have any problem, please contact me. 
Here are the suggested version.

### General
* cuda-9.0
* openmpi-1.10
* python3.6

### Python
* Please refer requirements.txt

## Usage

### Preprocess
Download MSMARCO dataset, GloVe embedding.
```
cd data
python3.6 download.py v1
```

Convert raw data to tsv format
```
python3.6 convert_msmarco.py
```

Convert tsv format to ctf(CNTK input) format and build vocabs dictionary
